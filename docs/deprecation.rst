Deprecation
===========

Layabout is deprecated as of **January 1st, 2020**.

What?
-----

There will be no further support for Layabout, **even for security issues**.
Layabout will likely continue to work as long as as the ``1.x`` family of the
`slackclient`_ library functions, but it is **strongly** recommended that you
migrate to the ``2.x`` family of `slackclient`_.

Why?
----

Please read the associated `blog post`_ that details the rationale for
deprecation. **TL;DR**: The ``2.x`` family of the official `slackclient`_
library includes updates that make Layabout obsolete.
